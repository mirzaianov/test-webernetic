# Webernetic Test Project

## Description

The layout starts with a sign-in `modal` window and later shows the `responsive component`.

The "modal" is a `dialog` component, hence it can be closed with `ESC`. 
Or just click the "cross" closing button or the form buttons.
A sign-in or a sign-up options are not implemented yet - will be added on request. The repsective buttons can also close the modal.

The "responsive component" changes it's outfit according to breakpoints from the requirements. Change the viewport width to see transformations.

## Execution

1. Run `index.html` on Live Server
